# JS30 Fun With HTML5 Canvas
Excorcise 08 in WesBos' JavaScript30 tutorials. 

What a fun one! The way Wes breaks up the 30 days so far at least in the 1st week is fantastic. A bit of pur JS with cardio days and some creative days sprinkled in such as this canvas or the flex panels exorcise. 

I knew nothing about creating a "paint" like app prior to this so all of the canvas & context info was new to me. Once explained everything seems so logical, but creating it from scratch is still quite a challenge of mine. I appreciated the different uses of "JS Flags" both for when to actually draw based on the mouse events and for reversing line size based on a range.

For my bonus piece I chose to continue the app and give the random colors a toggle function and a custom color picker that will toggle the random colors off.
